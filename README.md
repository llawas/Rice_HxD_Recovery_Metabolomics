# Rice_HxD_Recovery_Metabolomics_Recovery
Workflow for statistical analysis of GC-MS data from field-grown rice collected during rewatering after exposure to combined drought and heat stress

Experimental design: three-year field experiment; 
three rice cultivars with different tolerance to drought and heat stress used; 
combined drought and heat stress imposed at either the flowering or early grain-filling stage; 
flag leaves, flowering spikelets, and developing seeds collected from control and combined drought and heat stress treatments; 
samples collected at different time points (controls, late stress, 12 h after rewatering, 36 h after rewatering, 60 h after rewatering)

This workflow focuses on the analysis of samples collected during the recovery (rewatering) period.
